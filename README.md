This is a basic Age Calculator program written in Go. It asks the user to enter their year of birth and calculates their 
age based on the current year. The program uses Go’s built-in time and input-handling packages to keep things simple and
user-friendly. It’s a great project for beginners learning how to take user input, work with strings and numbers,
and use Go’s standard libraries.
